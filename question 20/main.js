//q 20:Think of something you could store in a array. For example, you could make a list of mountains, rivers,
// countries, cities, languages, or anything else youâ€™d like. Write a program that creates a list containing 
//these items.
//PROGRAMME:
var programingLanguages = ["python", "PHP", "javascript", "typescript"];
console.log("list of programming languages:");
console.log("".concat(programingLanguages));
//for(let i = 0;i < programingLanguages.length;i++){
//  console.log(programingLanguages[i]);
//}
