//q 20:Think of something you could store in a array. For example, you could make a list of mountains, rivers,
// countries, cities, languages, or anything else youâ€™d like. Write a program that creates a list containing 
//these items.

//PROGRAMME:

let programingLanguages: string[] = ["python","PHP","javascript","typescript"];



console.log("list of programming languages:")
console.log(`${programingLanguages}`);   

//or
 
for(let i = 0;i < programingLanguages.length;i++){
    console.log(programingLanguages[i]);
